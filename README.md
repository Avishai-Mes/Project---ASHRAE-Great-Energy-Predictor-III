# Project---ASHRAE-Great-Energy-Predictor-III
Project Overview:
Welcome to the Chilled Water Energy Consumption Prediction project. This data science initiative focuses on addressing the challenge of forecasting chilled water energy consumption in buildings. Leveraging historical energy usage data and observed weather conditions, my goal is to develop counterfactual models that predict energy consumption within specific 8-hour intervals on given dates.

This project is framed as a supervised learning regression problem, where machine learning models are employed to forecast chilled water energy consumption accurately. By matching projected model values against actual energy usage, I aim to assess the efficiency improvements in buildings, offering insights into potential energy and cost savings.

The project was written in SQL, R and Python. The notebooks are numbered according to the correct reading order. 
Please note: there is a switch back and forth several times between SQL and R. 
Each R notebook is accompanied by an HTML file created as an automatic output of RStudio.
