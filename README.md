# Project---ASHRAE-Great-Energy-Predictor-III
This project is centered on the creation of counterfactual models for chilled water energy consumption. These models are developed using historical energy usage data and observed weather conditions. The projected model values will be matched against the actual energy usage of buildings, allowing for an examination of energy and cost savings achieved through efficiency improvements.

This project approaches the energy prediction challenge as a regression problem. It involves forecasting the chilled water energy consumption of specific buildings on given dates within particular 8-hour time intervals.

The project was written in SQL, R and python. The notebooks are numbered according to the correct reading order. 
Please note: there is a switch back and forth several times between SQL and R. 
Each R notebook is accompanied by an HTML file created as an automatic output of RStudio.
